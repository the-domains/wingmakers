# Introduction

The WingMakers Materials are the creation of an anonymous visionary known as James Mahu. James has created all of the books, art, music, poetry, diagrams and philosophical writings that has become known as the _WingMakers Materials_.

Visionary artists are driven by a passion for art and storytelling. Sometimes they paint canvases that showcase fantastical worlds or write stories of complex worlds full of deep meaning. Sometimes they compose and perform original music that evokes imagery that is uncommonly inspired. And sometimes, their passion is to tell a story so layered that it possesses mythological proportions.

## The Writings of WingMakers

The written works of James Mahu are extensive, comprising thousands of pages of text, ranging from poetry, philosophy, spiritual novels and "how to" papers.

The Collected Works of the WingMakers Vol. I and II, The Weather Composer, Quantusum and The Dohrman Prophecy are among his most prized works. However, it was The Ancient Arrow Project, released in 2000, that serves as the core backbone of the WingMakers story. The Neruda Interviews, of which there are five, are extensions of The Ancient Arrow Project book that add important details to the story and philosophical work.****

James has also written a wide variety of philosophical papers for the serious metaphysical student. These papers have deep, contemporary insights into a diverse set of subjects like the heart-mind connection, heart virtues, cosmological structures, and the importance of behavioral intelligence. These papers provide practical tools to help one remodel their belief system.

The philosophical works provide ample texture and detail for students eager to explore how they can uncouple from centuries-old religious beliefs and create their own spiritual worldview that is more intuitive and inclusive of all life. These philosophical works also include a glossary and are divided into four philosophical papers. It's worth mentioning that the novels of James Mahu are deeply philosophical as well, and for those interested in challenging reading, _Quantusum_ is one of the best.

In 2004, James launched the Lyricus website , which represents yet another layer of this complex mythological story of how a future aspect of humanity was able to reach back through time and share some of its wisdom, technological revelations, as well as to point out some of the traps and pitfalls that await humanity in its journey through the 21st century.

In 2009, a new website was launched by James called Event Temples. It contained a variety of papers written by James, each dealing with the very practical methods of living from the heart, yet doing so with a coherent, non-sentimental sense of self. That is it to say, living in the heart was not the sweet, warm nectar of attaining nirvana, overcaring for the world, or the quiet contemplation at the foot of some self-annointed master. It was the diligent, hour-by-hour transmission of behaviors that stemmed from the virtues of the heart. James named them the Six Heart Virtues.

## The Art of WingMakers

****

The chamber paintings depict the visual art from The Ancient Arrow Project. As James puts it, they're "snapshots" of their equivalent form in motion. James refers to the origin of these paintings "as dynamic and animated by sound waves (music)." He, as the artist, has taken these snapshots and created still frames of each painting.

James created a unique method of developing these physical paintings using a multi-layered, signature process. This unique process is what enables the jewel tone, high-frequency colors he is seeking to achieve. His paintings have intricate details, because he covers the final layer in color pencil so the entire work is completed like a drawing. Each piece requires a minimum of 100-120 hours to complete.

When the WingMakers materials were initially released on the Internet, James, their author, remained anonymous. It wasn't until 2005 when he began to release hints of his existence and background. Among those "hints" were various interviews he allowed. Though they were sparingly doled out, interviews provided a great way for people to sense more of his perspective on spiritual themes, cosmology, religion and metaphysics.

****

The interviews of James Mahu provide a great way to engage the more practical methods of how to apply spiritual perspective into one's everyday life. They also provide a glimpse into the compelling vision of an author/artists/composer who is stimulating new conversations on the timeless topics of who we are; why we're here; and what's our purpose as individuals and a species as a whole?

## The Poetry of WingMakers

In the fifth interview of Dr. Jamisson Neruda, James revealed a major theme in the WingMakers work. The I AM consciousness is a very ancient perspective and enjoys a significant presence in many of the esoteric belief systems, going back thousands of years. It is, to many, the x-factor of human consciousness that separates us, presumably, from other intelligent mammals. James talks about it as an incomplete transmission. He coined the inflow and outflow of consciousness as _I Am, We Are_. The _I Am_ is the inflow of energy that supports the individual, while the outflow or _We Are_ is the connective tissue that enables our compassion and understanding to be transmitted to our fellow life forms.

The _I Am, We Are_ approach is an integral part of an exercise that James reveals in the fifth interview. It is a very powerful method to use breath with integration to the heart virtues of appreciation, compassion, forgiveness, humility, understanding and valor.

## First Source Transmissions

****

In 2001, the first music CD was released by James. It was called First Source. Within the WingMakers cosmology, there's not an extensive hierarchy made up of Gods, angels, demons and so on. There is, instead, First Source and its extension Spirit Intelligence. First Source is the primeval origins of sound and light, the vibrational essence that infuses life or consciousness in our universe though its vehicle of Spirit Intelligence. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4d2c9545-7214-4dee-95c9-9bf5ef36e873.png)

The First Source disc was the first release of the music (sound), but it also contained some transmissions that James reported as First Source transmissions. These transmissions were relatively short, but powerful. There were three transmissions and these are available in written and auditory form.

## The Music of WingMakers

The Hakomi Project is more abstract and has a bit more of an Eastern musical influence. Esteemed vocalists Charlottemarie joined James on these records and brought her classically trained vocals to superb use. ![](https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/61b9cbb820b54e6604aef2ef03bcc993/passthrough.jpg?height=217&input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fa8f44365d4f0f137cc4d114c6270067382832db9.jpg&width=750)

The four Hakomi CDs are great companions to the reading materials and many of the compositions are "journey" compositions, as James refers to them, meaning they evoke a sense of travel and not necessarily of the physical kind.

## The Sovereign Integral Consciousness

One of the constants in the WingMakers Materials is the construct of the Sovereign Integral. James has written in numerous places that there are certain words in his writings that are encoded with deeper meaning, and this is clearly one of them. In 2007 he released the diagram below which helps to explain the concept of simultaneous individuation of consciousness with what James called the Wholeness Paradigm.

We decelerate to sample personhood; the delicate crust of illusion
that begets our heart's intellect." ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8533496e-e0ff-4b30-a3f5-93b23af55703.jpg)
